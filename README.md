## Setup
**Requirements**

Gimme The Interval! requires a web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

**Running the Application**

- Clone the repository to your local machine 
`git clone https://github.com/marsobpro/intervals.git`
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser, or use a tool like Live Server to run the project on a local server.
- To use Live Server, open the project directory in Visual Studio Code and right-click the index.html file. Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
(Please note that this app contains audio files, which may not play if you simply open the index.html file in your browser. To ensure proper functionality, I recommend running the app on a local server, such as Live Server, rather than directly opening the HTML file.)

## Project Status
In progress.

## Room for Improvement
As part of further work on the application, I would like to add or improve the following functionalities:

- Enhance user experience by adding a quiz feature where the app plays two random notes and the user guesses the interval between them.

- Add the option for users to choose between different piano sounds and octaves, allowing for a customizable experience.

- Implement the ability for users to play notes using their computer keyboard, allowing for more natural and intuitive input.


## Acknowledgements
I created the piano sounds using Audacity and MuseScore applications.
